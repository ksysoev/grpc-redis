# Protoc Plugin Generator for Redis RPC

This package provides a plugin for the `protoc` utility, enabling the generation of Go code for [Redis RPC](http://github.com/ksysoev/redis-rpc) from Protocol Buffers (`.proto`) files. The plugin is designed to streamline the process of creating Go structs and service interfaces based on your Protocol Buffers definitions.
